# Installation

Loud Outline is a **desktop-only** plugin — it patches Obsidian's native file explorer directly,
which hasn't been verified against Obsidian Mobile yet. `isDesktopOnly: true` in `manifest.json`
reflects this.

## From Obsidian's Community Plugins browser

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**.
2. Search for "Loud Outline".
3. Click **Install**, then **Enable**.

## Manual install

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/danrfletcher/obsidian-loud-outline/releases/latest).
2. Create a folder named `loud-outline` inside your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory.
3. Place the three downloaded files inside it.
4. Reload Obsidian (or use **Settings → Community plugins → Reload plugins**).
5. Enable **Loud Outline** under **Settings → Community plugins**.

## BRAT (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tool)

If you use [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) to track plugins directly from
GitHub:

1. Install BRAT from the Community Plugins browser if you haven't already.
2. Run the **BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing** command.
3. Paste `danrfletcher/obsidian-loud-outline`.
4. BRAT installs it and will offer updates as new releases ship.
